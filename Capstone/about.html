            Griffin decks is owned and operated by Mike Griffin since 1995 serving Toronto, Mississauga, Burlington, Hamilton, Brampton, Georgetown and Milton.  Mike began his construction experience in structural framing while working a unionized job framing homes for some of the largest sub division and custom home builders.  After gaining years of experience, he decided to utilize this knowledge to provide quality deck building, something that was lacking in the industry at the time.  Mike brings this vast structural knowledge to every deck he builds.  He personally designs and custom builds each deck to suit the unique space, character, personal needs and lifestyle of the owners.  You can rest assured knowing your deck will be one of a kind.  His "no deposit until the job is done" policy is a testament to the fine workmanship he maintains with every deck he completes.  If you trust Mike to build your deck, he will trust you to pay when the job is done.
            
            On a personal note, Mike is a husband and father of two and therefore understands the importance of family.  He builds all decks as if they were his own, going beyond minimum code to ensure your family's safety for years to come.  He realizes the importance of pride in ownership and stands by everything he builds.  A deck built by Mike is a deck that will truly stand the test of time.
